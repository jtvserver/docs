# J-TV self server

## Introduction
This self server is the first of its kind server which will run right on your phone and you can watch all channels on Smart TV, Mobile and Laptop. It will let you generate all the personal playlists.

## Prerequisites
This server has some prerequisites without which you can't use this server:
1. An android phone. IOS may work but I haven't tested.
1. Jio number with subscription as you need to login.
1. Your phone and your TV or Laptop must be connected to the same wifi. In case you are watching on your phone, then this is not required.
1. Little brain as the process is little complicated. [Come on. You are setting up a server afterall]

## Let's get started
Go to play store and download Termux application.
